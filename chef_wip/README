This directory is temporary to contain chef ospf unnumbered/PTM/ZTP demo, till it is packaged into Debian package.

Steps:

1. check out this repo on CCW jump VM
2. Run provision-1.sh
3. Wait for 10 minutes (ZTP provisioning of chef package takes time)
4. Run provision-2.sh
5. To demo: login into nodes and run "chef-client" command. It pulls the recipe from server and configures for ospf unnumbered and PTM
